	<p>• Consider font choice for "Kimchi Fried Rice" title, as it looks too playful for a recipe page</p>
	<p>• The "servings...cook time" section has such little font size, size up to make it more legible for the viewers</p>
	<P>• Make the "Ingredients" and "Directions" headings more similar to each other with similar box sizes</P>
	<p>• Makes ure "Directions" heading is centered within the box</p>
	<p>• Adjust the spacing between each of the directions, as there are already too much space in between each steps</p>
	</section>

	<p>• The title "Kimchi Fried Rice" is too close to either side of the edges of the page, so maybe size down the font for a clearer visibility
	</p>
	<p>• Have the boxes for "Ingredients" and "Directions" be equal in size so they could be read the same </p>
	<p>• The spacing between each steps under "Directions" could be a lot smaller</p>
	<p> • Once you space out the spaces between each steps, consider using a background color! </p>

	<div> Planned Direction of Work </div>
	<p> After I have received feedback from my peers, I understood that my recipe page will need more consistency in design, and that it does not need huge spacing in between the elements on page. I will adjust my page based on the feedback, such as make the "Ingredients" and "Directions" heading be equal in size and space out between steps of direction. I will also explore more fonts for the title and also consider using background color or be more adventurous with the type of design I might want to create for the background.</p>
