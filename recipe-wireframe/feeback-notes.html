	<p><b>Feedback Received:</b></p>
	<div>1) Good color theme of red and yellow</div>
	<div>2) Maybe unify the color black for the actual directions on page 3,4,5</div>
	<div>3) Good use of pictures for every direction-makes it more legible and understandable</div>
	<div>4) Good division of each steps</div>
	<div>5) Maybe put the red end border on the last page “learn more recipes at—“  in similar manner to the one on front page (maybe put the last page’s red border towards the top of the image of the  last page)</div>
	<div>6) More exploration with fonts</div>

	<p><b> Intention of Direction</b></p>
	<div>I intend to explore more typefaces that feels more correspondent to my choice of refcipe, and bring more classificaiton and grouping into the page so it becomes more easily identifiable and understanable for the viewers. I will also try different layouts as well and see if there are more successful ones in delivering my recipe.</div>
